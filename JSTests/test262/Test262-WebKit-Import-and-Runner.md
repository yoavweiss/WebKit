# Test262 Import and Runner

## Summary

Test262 is a project maintained by Ecma\'s TC39 with conformance tests
for ECMA-262, ECMA-402 and ECMA-404, covering the language syntax and
built-in APIs. It\'s entirely written in JS.

In a local copy of the WebKit source...

Test262 is imported to the ./JSTests/test262 folder; helper files can be
found in ./JSTests/test262/harness and the actual test files are in
./JSTests/test262/test.

The Test262 import and runner scripts (test262-import and
test262-runner) are located in the ./Tools/Scripts folder, with
dependencies located in ./Tools/Scripts/test262.

To update WebKit\'s local Test262, execute
./Tools/Scripts/test262-import (if ./Tools/Scripts is in the env PATH,
execute test262-import).

To run WebKit\'s local Test262, execute ./Tools/Scripts/test262-runner
(if ./Tools/Scripts is in the env PATH, execute test262-runner).

## test262-import

The import script will fetch the master branch of Test262, published to
the official repository at
[[https://github.com/tc39/test262]{.underline}](https://github.com/tc39/test262).
The changes are applied in the ./JSTests/test262 folder, along with
additional information:

- test262-Revision.txt will store the latest import revision (the commit
  hash) and the source from the last import. This information is used to
  compare changes in further imports. Example:

> test262 remote url: git@github.com:tc39/test262.git
>
> test262 revision: 7dc92154af01c6772b1a773e1e9fcb706b863de0

- latest-changes-summary.txt will store a summary of the latest imported
  files, including status codes: (A) added, (M) modified, (R) renamed
  and (D) deleted files. This information is also useful to the runner
  if the user wants to check only the newly imported files.

Although it\'s not recommended, Test262 can be imported from a local
folder, using the \--src argument, ie. test262-import \--src \<folder\>.
The script can also import from a custom remote git source, ie.
test262-import \--remote \<url\>.

After updating Test262, a new commit is necessary. Running
test262-runner is also necessary to check for any new test results.

## test262-runner

When called with no arguments, this script will run all the tests from
Test262, with the exception of those files included in the skip list.
The skip list is defined in ./JSTests/test262/config.yaml. **Changes in
this file are not automated.** A human must add or remove tests to be
skipped. The skip list is also documentation of tests which are
failures, mostly due to known---and linked---bugs or new features not
yet implemented in JavaScriptCore. The skip list can list test files by
their path or using features tags, which correspond to metadata defined
in each of the Test262 test files. Executing test262-runner
−−skipped−files will run all of the skipped tests and flag any newly
passing tests.

Additional options and flags for test262-runner can be found by
executing test262-runner \--help.

When executed, the runner will read from
./JSTests/test262/expectations.yaml a list with tests files that are
expected to fail and their latest reported failure. If any new failure
is found, the runner will report them as new failures and will close the
program with a non-zero exit code.

With new changes from the JavaScriptCore source or with new updates from
Test262, it\'s important to record these files in the skip list, or as
new failures in the expectations file. This can be done by calling
test262-runner \--save and commit the changes.

The expectations file is a machine generated file that doesn\'t allow
tracking the reason or bugs referencing the failure, e.g. an
un-implemented Stage 3 feature. It\'s recommended to triage new failures
and add them to the skip list with a matching Bugzilla link using a
comment line. Note that the expectations file exists to unblock any
updates of Test262 into WebKit.

To run a specific file or folder, call test262-runner -o \<path\>. This
option can be stacked to multiple paths: test262-runner -o \<path1\> -o
\<path2\>.

To triage new failures from a recent Test262 import, there is an option
to run only the recently added and modified test files: test262-runner
−−latest−import.

For a complete run, including the tests that would be skipped, call:
test262-runner \--ignore-config.

By default, the test262-runner will try to detect the path for
JavaScriptCore, and it\'s also possible to provide a custom path calling
it with test262-runner −−jsc \<path-for-jsc\>, this will also try to set
the environment\'s DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH (if not yet defined). The default
JavaScriptCore path is detected in the following order, returning an
error if it doesn\'t find JavaScriptCore:

- The expected folder similar to calling webkit-build-directory \--debug

- The expected folder similar to calling webkit-build-directory
  (release)

- A path found calling which jsc

By default, the test262-runner uses 4 child processes per core to
execute a test run. If the target machine has 4 cores available, it will
use 16 children processes. If only 1 core is available, it will use 4
processes. To set a custom number of cores, the runner should be called
as test262-runner -p \<number\> with the desired number of cores to be
used.

When the test262-runner is done running the tests, it creates a git
ignored folder which contains the summaries and reports output by the
latest run. This folder is named test262-results and is placed in the
current folder where the runner was called.

This test262-results folder may contain the following files:

- index.html: an HTML report with a short summary and list of failures.
  It includes all the failures, not only the new failures.

- summary.html: presenting two tables of summaries of the results per
  path - folders and subfolders - and features from the frontmatter
  metadata.

- report.css: used in both HTML files.

- results.yaml: a long Yaml file with all the results, can be consumed
  by any script.

- summary.txt: a text version of the summaries.

- summary.yaml: a Yaml file with the data used for the summaries
