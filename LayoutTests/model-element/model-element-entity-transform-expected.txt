PASS <model> with empty source has entityTransform = identity
PASS <model> gets the updated entityTransform after change
PASS <model> gets the updated entityTransform after model source change
PASS <model> gets the identity entityTransform after model source removal
PASS <model> ignores entityTransform when stagemode is set
PASS <model> gets the updated entityTransform after rotation
PASS <model> with source that has zero depth should still scale to fit the portal
